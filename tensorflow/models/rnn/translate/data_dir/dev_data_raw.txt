Please.
Take my hand.
We're a bit late with this one, mate.
"Surely He shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler.
and from the noisome pestilence.
He shall cover thee with His feather.
and under His wings shalt thou trust.
His truth shall be thy shield and buckler." There you go. Head back.
You'll be all right now, chum.
Can it get worse?
Oh, yes, much worse.
Bring up the bulldozer.
Stretcher bearer!
Help me!
Stretcher.
Easy, now. Take it easy.
Morphia. I must have morphia.
Morphia is only for the people who are really hurt.
I thought I was really hurt.
Well, you're wrong.
I asked him to come over, but Dr. Spaander does agree with me.
 We've got to do something about them.  Yes, what? Good day, Doctor.
General Urquhart, we have no more space and we have no more supplies.
And since a prisoner of war.
has more chance than no chance at all.
I have a mind to ask the Germans.
to accept our wounded into their hospitals.
if we could arrange evacuation.
 Have I your permission to try?  Certainly.
If Weaver agrees. But I hardly think the Germans will.
Those are our guns out there. That's 30 Corps.
I don't think my permission is going to be your major problem.
I've come with a message from General Urquhart.
How you manage that?
I swam the Rhine, sir.
I'm afraid the radios are all up the spout.
The general asks if you'll get your men across the river.
We've been holding out for six days now.
Any help at all would be of considerable assistance.
You swim back with reply?
Yes, sir.
Well, we can't swim.
not with equipment.
We have small rubber boats, that's all.
I'm afraid rubber dinghies may be a bit flimsy for the Rhine, sir.
I agree.
Tell the general we're coming.
We're coming tonight.
Yes, sir.
Not possible.
If you would just say yes, it would be very possible.
Forgive me, but there is a battle.
and we are in the process of winning it.
Winning and losing is not our concern.
Living or dying is.
Cease fire.
one more hour, two.
just to evacuate our wounded.
Afterwards you can kill us as much as you want to.
General Ludwig.
 Will you thank him, please?  I just did.
Please, you can go.
How short are we? A mile?
Why don't we just try to bash through?
For God's sake, it must be worth it.
They're trying to force Urquhart away from the river.
Now, once they do that.
once they've got him surrounded, he'll be annihilated.
Not in Monty's plan at all.
Have we replaced the boats we lost at Nijmegen?
Yes.
Well?
Well, then?
Well, that's it then. We're pulling them out.
It was Nijmegen.
It was the single road getting to Nijmegen.
No, it was after Nijmegen.
And the fog.
in England.
It doesn't matter what it was.
When one man says to another, "Today let's play the war game".
everybody dies.
"Withdraw"?
Two days, they said. We've been here nine.
One bloody mile. You'd think they could accomplish that.
 Hancock, here are another two.  All right. Thank you.
They're the last two I could find.
Charles?
We've been given our marching orders.
If they discover we're leaving, they'll go all out to destroy us.
So we must take every precaution.
I've designed this like a collapsing bag.
Macdonald here has agreed to man the wireless.
in order to give the Germans something to listen to.
All the padres and medical staff have volunteered to stay behind as well.
Now, the wounded who are too bad to move.
will replace the men firing.
so our defense will seem as before.
By the time the Germans find out what's happening.
we should all be safely across the river.
 Pleasant journey.  Thank you, sir.
 Are you all right, laddie?  Thank you, sir.
I'm beginning to believe we're actually going to make it, sir.
I thought everyone knew God was a Scotsman.
Come on. Don't hang about.
General Browning will be down right away, sir.
He wondered if you perhaps might like to change.
 Change?  Your clothes, sir.
No, thanks.
Hello, Roy.
How are you?
I'm not sure that I'll know for a while.
But I'm sorry about the way it worked out.
You did all you could.
Yes, but did everyone else?
They've got a bed for you upstairs, if you want it.
I took 10,000 men into Arnhem.
I've come out with less than 2,000.
I don't feel much like sleeping.
Quite.
I've just been on to Monty.
He's very proud and pleased.
 Pleased?  Of course.
He thinks Market Garden was 90% successful.
But what do you think?
Well, as you know, I've always thought we tried to go a bridge too far.
Mind his head.
Thanks, Taff.
Why the hell do you always carry that bloody umbrella?
 Memory.  What?
Bad memory.
Always forgot the password.
I knew no Jerry.
would ever carry one.
I had.
to prove I was an Englishman.
Get back! Back into the houses.
30 Corps, please hurry.
 Nothing, sir.  All right. Thank you, Corporal.
It's no use in any event. Take my boot off, will you, Wicks?
Hello, 30 Corps.
Oh, God!
We're out of ammunition anyway.
Right. Off you go, Wicks. Join the rest of the lads.
Try and get back to the main force.
 What about you, sir?  I'll be all right.
We just didn't make it this time, did we?
Calling 30 Corps. Come in, please.
My general says please take it.
It's very good chocolate.
Your planes dropped it to us yesterday.
English.
Action stations!
God bless Field Marshal Montgomery.
Would five minutes be too much?
Just five minutes respite.
Dear God.
grant these young men.
die in peace and quiet.
I'm sorry, lads, but you're going to have to move.
